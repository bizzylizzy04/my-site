		<h2 id="about">About Me:</h2>
		<p>My name is Liz. I grew up in Northeast Iowa and have spent most of my life there. Though I did spend a short time, years ago, living in Texas. If you can't tell from my t-shirt, I'm an Iowa Hawkeyes fan. Go Hawks! The picture above was taken at Dog Beach in San Diego, CA, April 2015. I was visiting my friend Robert. We spent the week swimming at five different beaches, whale watching, going to the zoo, and other sight-seeing. That was the first time I had ever seen the ocean. In April 2017, I will be taking a trip back to San Diego to celebrate Robert's wedding! This time my sister is coming along and we are going to take a trip to Los Angeles. I don't get to travel often, but when I do, I make the most out of it and enjoy the time away from home.</p>

		<p>In August 2015, I graduated from Upper Iowa University with a Bachelor of Science in Financial Management. However, I have always had a love of art and technology and during college I took a Mangement Information Systems course where I learned HTML and CSS. There is an art to coding that I really enjoy. So I made the decision to follow my interests and learn more about coding and web development by taking some training courses. Through <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com">Skillcrush's</a> Web Developer Blueprint. We learned HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Git, and GitHub. At <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, I have completed the HTML/CSS course and am currently in process of completing the Ruby course. At <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>, I'm working through the Front End Development Certification.</p>

		<p>Below you'll find some of my projects. Please check out my <a href="https://github.com/bizzylizzy04" target="_blank">Github</a> page for my Ruby projects.</p>
