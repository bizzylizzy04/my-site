      <p>If there is any one thing that separates the caves at Aquos from anywhere else on earth, it is their diversity.  The ocean caves here are literally filled with marine life such as sponges, lobsters, crabs and shrimp.  The entrances of many ocean blue holes can only be described as over stocked aquariums!  Inland caves vary from deep fracture caves and sinkholes, to shallower incredibly decorated passages filled with water as clear as air. So whether you are into depth, distance, beauty or the most diverse ecosystems found in any undewater caves in the world , you can be sure that you will find it here in the Bahamas.</p>
